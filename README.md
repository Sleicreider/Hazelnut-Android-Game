Is a Mobile 2D Game based on the idea of an old PC game.  
Mainly developed for fun, nostalgia, and trying out cocos2d-x.

Majority of the code was developed in my early stages with C++ / C++11, therefore might contain not well designed code,
different coding styles / naming conventions, inefficient code.

Tested with cocos2d-x v3.5.

Engine submodule required to compile: Slei/Hazelnut/cocos2d/<cocos2d-x engine-content>
